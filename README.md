**Title: Comprehensive Analysis of Hospital Care Quality Measures in the United States**

**Description**

This master's thesis examines hospital care quality indicators across the United States, providing a comparative analysis of over 8000 hospitals across 56 federal states, regions, and territories. 
Through extensive data collection (2016-2020) from sources like CMS and AHRQ,  this research aims to:

* Evaluate hospital performance based on various quality measures.
* Identify regional variations in care quality and highlight potential areas for improvement.
* Emphasize a patient-centered perspective by analyzing patient-reported outcomes.
* Utilize the KMeans clustering algorithm to group hospitals with similar characteristics.

**Key Findings**

* **Top-Rated States:** Iowa (IA), Ohio (OH), Oklahoma (OK), and Wisconsin (WI) consistently demonstrate high-quality healthcare services over five years. 
* **State-Level Leaders:**
    * Texas: Excels in patient experience and timeliness of care.
    * California: Focus on safety of care and minimizing mortality rates.
    * Florida:  Prioritizes reducing readmission rates.
* **Clustering:** KMeans algorithm with Silhouette scores of 0.14-0.15 suggests reasonable cluster separation.

**Methodology**

* **Data Sources:** Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and potentially others.
* **Quality Measures:** Patient survey star rating, hospital overall rating, national comparison indicators, HCAHPS linear mean value, and more.
* **Analysis Techniques:** Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, geospatial visualization, and KMeans clustering.

**Outcomes**

* Identifies high-performing hospitals and those needing improvement.
* Informs policymakers and administrators for evidence-based decision-making.
* Contributes to ongoing efforts to enhance healthcare quality nationwide.

**Potential Project Extensions**

* **More Granular Data:**  Explore datasets with finer details for more nuanced analyses of individual patient experiences within hospitals.
* **Additional Machine Learning:** Employ other clustering or classification techniques to uncover different insights or identify trends.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Examine trends in hospital quality measures over extended time periods for a broader understanding of the evolution of healthcare quality.
